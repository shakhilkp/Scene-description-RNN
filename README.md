# Scene-description-RNN
Scene description for visually impaired people using Deep Learning.
We present a model that automatically learns to recognize the content of photos and generate a caption pertinent to them, drawing inspiration from recent work in machine translation and object identification. This is a fascinating/challenging subject for AI, integrating elements of computer vision (in particular scene interpretation) with natural language processing because humans can accomplish this with remarkable ease. The algorithm learns to focus on specific regions while creating a caption, much to how human eyesight fixates when you see the visual world. Convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and research on modeling attention mechanisms are all included in the model.
